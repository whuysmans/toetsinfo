With this tool you can export Canvas quiz questions to PDF. It uses Canvas OAuth2 for authentication; once logged in you will have a subset of the permissions you have in Canvas. Fill in course ID and quiz ID and it will generate a PDF. It is a webapp that must be hosted on an environment which supports NodeJS (my version is hosted on Heroku). The institution details are stored as ENV variables on the host. This will only work for classic quizzes, since the API doesn't provide access to the new quizzes yet.
